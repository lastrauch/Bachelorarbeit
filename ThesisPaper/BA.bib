	abstract="This paper presents empirical results for several versions of the multinomial naive Bayes classifier on four text categorization problems, and a way of improving it using locally weighted learning. More specifically, it compares standard multinomial naive Bayes to the recently proposed transformed weight-normalized complement naive Bayes classifier (TWCNB) [1], and shows that some of the modifications included in TWCNB may not be necessary to achieve optimum performance on some datasets. However, it does show that TFIDF conversion and document length normalization are important. It also shows that support vector machines can, in fact, sometimes very significantly outperform both methods. Finally, it shows how the performance of multinomial naive Bayes can be improved using locally weighted learning. However, the overall conclusion of our paper is that support vector machines are still the method of choice if the aim is to maximize accuracy.",

	abstract="Binary responses are commonly studied in many fields. Examples includeresponsebinary1 the presence or absence of a particular disease, death during surgery, or a consumer purchasing a product. Often one wishes to study how a set of predictor variables X is related to a dichotomous response variable Y. The predictors may describe such quantities as treatment assignment, dosage, risk factors, and calendar time. For convenience we define the response to be Y = 0 or 1, with Y = 1 denoting the occurrence of the event of interest. Often a dichotomous outcome can be studied by calculating certain proportions, for example, the proportion of deaths among females and the proportion among males. However, in many situations, there are multiple descriptors, or one or more of the descriptors are continuous. Without a statistical model, studying patterns such as the relationship between age and occurrence of a disease, for example, would require the creation of arbitrary age groups to allow estimation of disease prevalence as a function of age.",
