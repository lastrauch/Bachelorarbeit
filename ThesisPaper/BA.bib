	abstract="This paper presents empirical results for several versions of the multinomial naive Bayes classifier on four text categorization problems, and a way of improving it using locally weighted learning. More specifically, it compares standard multinomial naive Bayes to the recently proposed transformed weight-normalized complement naive Bayes classifier (TWCNB) [1], and shows that some of the modifications included in TWCNB may not be necessary to achieve optimum performance on some datasets. However, it does show that TFIDF conversion and document length normalization are important. It also shows that support vector machines can, in fact, sometimes very significantly outperform both methods. Finally, it shows how the performance of multinomial naive Bayes can be improved using locally weighted learning. However, the overall conclusion of our paper is that support vector machines are still the method of choice if the aim is to maximize accuracy.",

Examples includeresponsebinary1 the presence or absence of a particular disease, death during surgery, or a consumer purchasing a product. Often one wishes to study how a set of predictor variables X is related to a dichotomous response variable Y. The predictors may describe such quantities as treatment assignment, dosage, risk factors, and calendar time. For convenience we define the response to be Y = 0 or 1, with Y = 1 denoting the occurrence of the event of interest. Often a dichotomous outcome can be studied by calculating certain proportions, for example, the proportion of deaths among females and the proportion among males. However, in many situations, there are multiple descriptors, or one or more of the descriptors are continuous. Without a statistical model, studying patterns such as the relationship between age and occurrence of a disease, for example, would require the creation of arbitrary age groups to allow estimation of disease prevalence as a function of age.",

	abstract = {The computational power of massively parallel networks of simple processing elements resides in the communication bandwidth provided by the hardware connections between elements. These connections can allow a significant fraction of the knowledge of the system to be applied to an instance of a problem in a very short time. One kind of computation for which massively parallel networks appear to be well suited is large constraint satisfaction searches, but to use the connections efficiently two conditions must be met: First, a search technique that is suitable for parallel networks must be found. Second, there must be some way of choosing internal representations which allow the preexisting hardware connections to be used efficiently for encoding the constraints in the domain being searched. We describe a general parallel search method, based on statistical mechanics, and we show how it leads to a general learning rule for modifying the connection strengths so as to incorporate knowledge about a task domain in an efficient way. We describe some simple examples in which the learning algorithm creates internal representations that are demonstrably the most efficient way of using the preexisting connectivity structure.},

You’ll start by covering the mathematical prerequisites and the fundamentals of deep learning and NLP with practical examples. The first three chapters of the book cover the basics of NLP, starting with word-vector representation before moving onto advanced algorithms. The final chapters focus entirely on implementation, and deal with sophisticated architectures such as RNN, LSTM, and Seq2seq, using Python tools: TensorFlow, and Keras. Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing follows a progressive approach and combines all the knowledge you have gained to build a question-answer chatbot system. This book is a good starting point for people who want to get started in deep learning for NLP. All the code presented in the book will be available in the form of IPython notebooks and scripts, which allow you to try out the examples and extend them in interesting ways. You will: Gain the fundamentals of deep learning and its mathematical prerequisites Discover deep learning frameworks in Python Develop a chatbot Implement a research paper on sentiment classification.}

	abstract = "Time underlies many interesting human behaviors. Thus, the question of how to represent time in connectionist models is very important. One approach is to represent time implicitly by its effects on processing rather than explicitly (as in a spatial representation). The current report develops a proposal along these lines first described by Jordan (1986) which involves the use of recurrent links in order to provide networks with a dynamic memory. In this approach, hidden unit patterns are fed back to themselves; the internal representations which develop thus reflect task demands in the context of prior internal states. A set of simulations is reported which range from relatively simple problems (temporal version of XOR) to discovering syntactic/semantic features for words. The networks are able to learn interesting internal representations which incorporate task demands with memory demands; indeed, in this approach the notion of memory is inextricably bound up with task processing. These representations reveal a rich structure, which allows them to be highly context-dependent, while also expressing generalizations across classes of items. These representations suggest a method for representing lexical categories and the type/token distinction."

It shows blind beliefs, opinions and unreasonable adherence to a party, idea, faction or a person. Through this task, we aim to develop an automated system that can be used to detect hyperpartisan news and serve as a prescreening technique for fake news detection. The proposed system jointly uses a rich set of handcrafted textual and semantic features. Our system achieved 2nd rank on the primary metric (82.0{\%} accuracy) and 1st rank on the secondary metric (82.1{\%} F1-score), among all participating teams. Comparison with the best performing system on the leaderboard shows that our system is behind by only 0.2{\%} absolute difference in accuracy.",

Using a subset of hand-labeled articles from SemEval as a validation set, we test the performance of different parameters for BERT models. We find that accuracy from two different BERT models using different proportions of the articles is consistently high, with our best-performing model on the validation set achieving 85{\%} accuracy and the best-performing model on the test set achieving 77{\%}. We further determined that our model exhibits strong consistency, labeling independent slices of the same article identically. Finally, we find that randomizing the order of word pieces dramatically reduces validation accuracy (to approximately 60{\%}), but that shuffling groups of four or more word pieces maintains an accuracy of about 80{\%}, indicating the model mainly gains value from local context.",

If one is able to reliably compute this meta information, news articles may be automatically tagged, this way encouraging or discouraging readers to consume the text. It is an open question how successfully hyperpartisan news detection can be automated, and the goal of this SemEval task was to shed light on the state of the art. We developed new resources for this purpose, including a manually labeled dataset with 1,273 articles, and a second dataset with 754,000 articles, labeled via distant supervision. The interest of the research community in our task exceeded all our expectations: The datasets were downloaded about 1,000 times, 322 teams registered, of which 184 configured a virtual machine on our shared task cloud service TIRA, of which in turn 42 teams submitted a valid run. The best team achieved an accuracy of 0.822 on a balanced sample (yes : no hyperpartisan) drawn from the manually tagged corpus; an ensemble of the submitted systems increased the accuracy by 0.048.",
